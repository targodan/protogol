# Proto-go-l

This little experimental project aims to create a generic framework to implement arbitrary protocols in go.
Protocols are going to be defined by state machines and the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

I don't know how far I'm going to push this project so use with care.

**Warning:**
This project is as of yet completely undocumented and it will stay that way until I feel ready for a first version 0.1
